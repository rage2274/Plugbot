## Plug.bot

A collection of extensions to the growing online DJing website, <a href="http://plug.dj">plug.dj</a>.  The source code is written in JavaScript and uses the Plug.dj API anywhere possible.  Easily embeddable as a bookmark in your favorite browser.  Initially inspired by TechGuard's AutoWoot script from April 2012.

###<strong>I'm running out of ideas about what to add to Plug.bot.  If you have any ideas, e-mail me!</strong>


### Features List ###

Feature | Purpose
--------|--------
Auto Woot | Automatically WOOT! each song as it is played
Auto Queue | Automatically add yourself back to the DJ Waitlist once you've been moved back into the crowd
Userlist | A dynamic list of every user in the room, color-coded by their current vote.  Green = "Woot", Red = "Meh", White = No vote  Special usergroups (i.e. moderator) are denoted by the icon you'd normally see in the chat
Toggle UI | Allows you to easily configure your Plug.bot experience;  enable or disable each of its features at the click of a button.  Red = Off, Green = On
Hide Video | Hides videos from view on the site -- this is in effect until disabled
Skip Video | This is exactly like hide video, except it additionally mutes the audio and will automatically re-enable everything after the current video is over


### Bugfixes ###

This is where I will map out any bug fixing, in other words small issue solving that doesn't equate to a full version change.  Started September 14, 2013.

Release Date | Change
-------------|--------
September 20, 2013 | <ul><li>Fixed userlist icons except for Featured DJ.  Sorry DJs :(</li></ul>
September 14, 2013 | <ul><li>Temporarily removed adding pictures to the userlist based on the user's permissions because I no longer have said pictures.  Looking to recover them or make new ones soon.</li><li>Minor tweaks in documentation.</li></ul>


### Installation ###

Drag the text from the link below (it will look like code) into your Bookmarks Bar and it should make a new bookmark.  You can label it yourself, it doesn't matter.  Then just click the bookmark whenever you're on Plug.dj and you're good to go.

Install [this bookmarklet](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=ywuQK2XA) in order to run Plug.bot.  If you have a problem with installing the bookmarklet, just Google it, there are plenty of solutions to be found.  DO NOT e-mail me about it.  The ONLY time the bookmark will ever not work is if Github is down, and that's pretty rare so don't be worried (it happened for less than 24 hours last year and then it was back to normal.)
